# Serverless Application using AWS

This repository contains a serverless application built using various AWS services and serverless technologies. The application is designed to be highly scalable, cost-effective, and easy to deploy.

## Architecture Overview

The architecture of this serverless application is based on the following AWS services:

1. AWS Lambda: It provides the compute power to run serverless functions, enabling event-driven and on-demand execution.

2. API Gateway: It acts as a front-end for the application, exposing RESTful APIs that trigger the Lambda functions.

3. AWS DynamoDB: It serves as the NoSQL database for storing and retrieving application data.

4. Amazon S3: It is used for storing and serving static assets, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.

5. AWS CloudFormation: It is utilized for infrastructure deployment and management using infrastructure-as-code.

6. AWS CloudWatch: It enables monitoring and logging of application and infrastructure metrics.

## Getting Started

To deploy and run this serverless application, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chibuezedev/Serverlite.git
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies using package manager of your choice (e.g., npm, yarn):

   ```bash
   cd your-repo
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure AWS credentials on your machine. You can do this by installing the AWS CLI and running `aws configure`, or by setting the environment variables `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and `AWS_REGION`.

4. Deploy the application using the provided CloudFormation template:

   ```bash
   npm run deploy
   ```

   This will create the necessary AWS resources and deploy the application.

5. Once the deployment is complete, you will receive an API endpoint URL. You can use this URL to interact with the application.

## Usage

The serverless application provides the following functionalities:

1. **Endpoint 1**: This endpoint allows you to perform action 1. Usage: `HTTP_METHOD /api/endpoint-1`.

2. **Endpoint 2**: This endpoint allows you to perform action 2. Usage: `HTTP_METHOD /api/endpoint-2`.

3. **Endpoint 3**: This endpoint allows you to perform action 3. Usage: `HTTP_METHOD /api/endpoint-3`.

Feel free to explore and customize the application according to your needs.

## Monitoring and Logging

The serverless application is integrated with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring and logging. You can access logs and metrics through the AWS Management Console or use the AWS CLI commands.

## Cleaning Up

To avoid incurring unnecessary costs, make sure to delete the AWS resources when you're done using the application. You can do this by running the following command:

```bash
npm run cleanup
```

This will delete the CloudFormation stack and associated resources.
